		<h1>Our Story</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="relationship">
		<h3>First We Meet</h3>
		<p class="caps">August 2015</p>
		<p>Talked at a table together in the dorm commons with some friends and the fireworks went off. Laura thought his hair would feel like a chia pet.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="relationship">
		<h3>First Date</h3>
		<p class="caps">November 25th, 2015</p>
		<p>Kyle took Laura to an Italian restaurant near their college. It was a surprise that he was taking her for a date, so Laura was not formally dressed. (tank top and short shorts) Kyle even made sure he wasn't on his phone the whole time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="relationship">
		<h3>The Proposal</h3>
		<p id="caps">October 9th, 2020</p>
		<p>Kyle arranged for family to share this special day with him (without Laura even knowing). Laura says it is her best day of her life. Before he dropped to one knee, Laura thought "the only way this day could be better is if we went camping".</p>
